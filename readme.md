# Markdown

## History

Some dudes in 2004 wanted a standard, minimalist markup language that was human readable (for real human readable, not like “I can read XML!!!” readable 😐), but could be easily transposed to standard machine formats (i.e. HTML, etc.).

## Standards

Despite the name, I’d say GFM (Github flavored Markdown used on Github and Gitlab) is the de facto standard, but it’s possible you’ll encounter something else. A notable place Commonmark would be encountered is Bitbucket 🙁.

GFM and Commonmark are generally compatible. I find myself using a couple features of GFM that are missing from Commonmark. For user docs, tables are great. For my personal stuff GFM’s checklists are nice to have (a list of GFM’s “missing” features are [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#GitHub_Flavored_Markdown_(GFM))).

## “Cheat sheets”

The “new standard” [Github Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/): 

More of an actual [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) (GFM focused) 

Commonmark [cheatsheet](https://commonmark.org/help/)

Bitbucket [specific cheatsheet](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/markdown-syntax-guide-776639995.html) 

## Examples

Demo in VSCode! 

Download the VSCode extension “[Markdown all in one](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)” (optional, but highly recommended). Main benefits of this plugin are quality of life things such as “text editor like” shortcut keys for doing things like bolding and auto hyperlink creation and (my favorite) print to HTML. This allows creating PDF’s using your browser of choice in order to easily make professional looking docs from your notes (Chrome creates good PDF’s, BTW).

Note: VSCode already does "syntax highlighting" and preview mode for MD without this extension.

Also open the markdowndemo.md file shared with you in google drive.
