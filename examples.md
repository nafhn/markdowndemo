# Some Code

Inline code looks like this: `echo 'Hello!'` and can have text around it.

Code can also be placed in a block and have it's language defined for better syntax highlighting.

```bash
echo 'Hello World!'
```

```ruby
puts 'Hello World!'
```

```powershell
Write-Host "Hello World!"
```

```python
print('Hello World!') 
```

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
